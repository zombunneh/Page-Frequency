# In here we call our methods to create the following workflow:
# Query user to search through 1 page or multiple pages
# Access the page(s)
# Scrape the text from it (relevant text only?)
# Compile a frequency list of words from the page
# Translate text from specified language to english
# Display the results to the user
# Export the results for use elsewhere e.g. anki deck (formatted in csv/txt etc)

# Future improvements
# TODO: add functionality to read a collection of webpages from a master page rather than having to add specific pages
